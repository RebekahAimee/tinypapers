For the main list to scroll, you have to implement ScrollView.
You can't use relative sizes (i.e., size_hint stuff) in the direction you want 
to scroll; you should measure the list elements' height in display pixels (dp).
Otherwise the elements will autosize to share space on the screen no matter
how many there are or whether they can realistically fit.

You can however (and should) use size_hint in the direction you're not
scrolling. For tinypapers the size_hint that should be left alone is
size_hint_x, because you want to scroll up and down (the y axis).
